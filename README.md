# CUDA Project

CUDA was the 3rd place winner of the 2021-2022 UCSB E.C.E. Capstone program. The project goal was to produce fast medical tests that users can trust.

# This Repo

This repo contains the React Native application. The final version of the CUDA app is hosted here, as it was shown in the 2022 capstone presentations. 

# Mobile App Demo

The following is an uncut demo video of the mobile app performing a fibrinogen test. The iPhone used is connected via BLE to the companion device, the CUDA Reader.
